# The Experiment

## Introduction

This is a social experiment.

Our goal is to determine whether it's possible to spontanteously create an open source movement out of nothing.

Everything starts with the first section of this `README.md` file. Its only purpose is to provide instructions for people to turn this document into an open source movement.

This document has been created without any mission, vision, strategy, or intellectual property. That is to be filled in and expanded upon by you and others like you.

The instructions for how to participate in this experiment are simple:

1. Fork this repository and update its contents however you wish.
2. Update the ownership section to allocate virtual tokens to yourself to reflect your contribution.
3. Submit a pull request.

Here's how this document is to be governed:

1. All pull requests will be reviewed and judged based on their contributions and requested allocations.
2. Pull requests will be accepted until the project has a clear direction and plan.
3. This repository will eventually be transferred to the largest virtual token holder for continued management.
4. The new repository owner may create a corporate entity and/or blockchain entity and reward participants in some way, completely at their discretion.
